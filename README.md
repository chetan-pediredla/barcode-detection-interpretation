# barcode-interpretation
Barcode interpretation is the process of extracting information from barcodes, which are optical codes consisting of parallel lines of varying widths and spacing. Barcodes are widely used for tracking products, inventory management, and document tracking. Barcode interpretation involves capturing the barcode image using a scanner or camera, decoding the information using specialized software or algorithms, and verifying the decoded information for accuracy. The decoded information can be used for various purposes such as inventory tracking, shipping, and point-of-sale transactions. Barcode interpretation is an important application of computer vision and image processing, and requires specialized knowledge and expertise in these areas.
